I try to make Jo\u0026rsquo;s jacket, from 2 QCube (15/08/2025 image) for shape block out (the first QCube is neck collar and second for jacket), Move brush and Gizmo to get tha basic shape after that use the jacket base mesh add neck collar (with ZModeller), after clean up you have a full jacket at lowest polycount base on the collar base mesh. The neck collar base mesh will be use for fur in the jacket latter. Now it time to add thickness with ZModeler, after that add subdivision, then carving detail with Damstandard. The arm jacket part I will work from a Capsle base mesh from IMM Primitive brush, If I haven\u0026rsquo;t pose first then make the jacket, then I could have not need to create the arm jacket from IMM brush and may be the jacket may look better. Now, I make sure to scale the capsle to arm size but a bit larger then move and modify with Gizmo and Move Brush \u0026gt; Add line/clothes folds with damstandard. Next I use Topology brush for pocket in Jacket \u0026gt; ZModeler add more polyloop then QMesh to carve out pocket hole \u0026gt; Subdiv for higher res \u0026gt; Use Standard + Damstandard for clothes folds/line on Pocket. For all Clothes metal screws I use IMM Clothes something Brush.\n01/09/2025 This is what the finish clothes look like. For the gun and gun bags I use the Alter 1/8 scale figure of Jo as reference. The gun was the hardest parts, using Qcube, Cylinder,\u0026hellip; to block out \u0026gt; then cut out part with live boolean, other small details is a seperate subtool, whena all is done add crease by polygroup \u0026gt; subdiv \u0026gt; uncrease \u0026gt; add subdiv \u0026gt; polish in the end. I block out gunbag from the Q cube until I satisfied with the shape then add thick ness then scale it to the body of Jo. The leather lace around the pant is make with a custom curve brush. Stiching line is Damstandard with intensity at 50, rolldist 2.18 and lazy radius 21. The buckle was make from a q cube then modified with gizmo, the same process applied to all the straps, leather part. The fur on coat was make using the part from the hair. And the metalparts left/right jacket as well as other metal part was made by modified from the default Imm brush for clothing parts. For the base just start from the qcube \u0026gt; dynamesh ~ 400 \u0026gt; use TrimSmoothBorder brush to carve then mask lasso + gizmo to create unenven surface, add details with clayBuildup, carve crack with orb crack when done, smooth using smooth valley brush. Then pant the primary color with on base \u0026gt; mask by cavity \u0026gt; reverse mask \u0026gt; use darker color to paint shadow.
