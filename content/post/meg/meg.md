## Finale ZBursh Viewport
 
`14/10/2025` I changed placement of the rifle. Since it was impossible to have it hanged at the back with while having her hair floating in the air. And I had changed the base for all previous characters as well to suit with Meg's base. Images bellow is the final stage of Meg, now I will prepare her to 3D render.
