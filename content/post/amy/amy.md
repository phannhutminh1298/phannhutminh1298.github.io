This time I will make Amy from Bakuretsu Tenshi. I already have a pose in mind, and most of her clothes and accessories are not as complex as Jo's, so hopefully her figure will turn out nicely.

## Base body and head

`05/09/2025` Head and hair (inproress). Just adjust the head from the base mesh and block out some hair with custom hair brush.
