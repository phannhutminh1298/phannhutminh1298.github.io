This time I will make Amy from Bakuretsu Tenshi. I already have a pose in mind, and most of her clothes and accessories are not as complex as Jo's, so hopefully her figure will turn out nicely.

## Base body and head

`05/09/2025` Head and hair (inproress). Just adjust the head from the base mesh and block out some hair with custom hair brush.

`07/09/2025` WIP head and hair.

`10/09/2025` WIP pose for now, may adjust later. I made her shoes first so Posing will be easier, the shoes design was base on the anime version of Amy rather than her figure ver from Alter.

## Clothes + Accessories

## The plushi
