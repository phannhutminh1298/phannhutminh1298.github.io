This time I will make Amy from Bakuretsu Tenshi. I already have a pose in mind, and it's not as complex as Jo's, so hopefully her figure will turn out nicely.

## Base body and head

## Clothes + Accessories

## The plushi

## Finale ZBursh Viewport

## 3D Render in Marmoset Toolbag 5

### Turntable
