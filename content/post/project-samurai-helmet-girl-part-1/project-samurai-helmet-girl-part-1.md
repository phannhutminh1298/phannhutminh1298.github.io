Hi, I'll start a new 3d fanart project of Huke's Illustration. I'll keep updating this post until I finish the over all 3D model. I'm planning part 2 will be for render and part 3 will be cutting the model for 3D print.

## Body Basemesh

Using an already made basemesh from my old project with some modifications. Since her arms is mechanical and bigger than average human arm so I'll leave the basemesh as it is.

## Head Details

The head part is really hard when combine with making eyeglasses and helmet. This is as best as I can make to resemble the original artwork.

> To make the eyeglasses's lens transparent I have to change it matterial to Glass then go to Display Properties and BPR Settings then lower Visibility slider. After that click BPR render in Render.

## Clothing & Accessories

She barely wear anything at all, so the challenge part is armors, which is really hard (for me). Since trying to match armors with the reference is impossible. I just can't nail it, because it will ruin the all my efforts that I put in posing earlier. Here are some quick update.

I'll try to finish all the armor parts before going back to hair and clothes.

### 16-06-2025

Update progress on armor, I'll start working on the sword from now. And after that, I'll will add some metal surface details to all metal part. Then, I'll work on the hair and finish the base.
Right now, my model has reach 60 mil polycount ~ 5gb ram used, which causing some lag when all subtools is onscreen, so I'll have to buy a PC to be able finish this model.

## Refine

I'll refine every things, including things I make but haven't post any image here. After everything is done, I'll start to make the base.
Her sword is massive, it's length is twice the height of her. I'm not sure about whether I'll try to keep it that way to match the original artwork. That why I haven't upload any full size image of it.

### Hair

#### 22-06-2025

Continue working on hair. I realize that working on hair, after everything else is done easier, I can ensure hair position, no overlap other parts.

(In progess...)
