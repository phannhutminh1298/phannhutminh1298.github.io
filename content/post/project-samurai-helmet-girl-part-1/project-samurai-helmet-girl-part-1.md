Hi, I'll start a new 3d fanart project of Huke's Illustration. I'll keep updating this post until I finish the over all 3D model. I'm planning part 2 will be for render and part 3 will be cutting the model for 3D print.

## Body Basemesh

Using an already made basemesh from my old project with some modifications. Since her arms is mechanical and bigger than average human arm so I'll leave the basemesh as it is.
