Hi, I'll start a new 3d fanart project of Huke's Illustration. I'll keep updating this post until I finish the over all 3D model. I'm planning part 2 will be for render and part 3 will be cutting the model for 3D print.

## Body Basemesh

Using an already made basemesh from my old project with some modifications. Since her arms is mechanical and bigger than average human arm so I'll leave the basemesh as it is.

## Head Details

The head part is really hard when combine with making eyeglasses and helmet. This is as best as I can make to resemble the original artwork.

> To make the eyeglasses's lens transparent I have to change it matterial to Glass then go to Display Properties and BPR Settings then lower Visibility slider. After that click BPR render in Render.

## Clothing

(in progress...)
