Hi, this time I'll make XNFE - /Nafe/ from Black Rock Shooter The Game.

I'll keep updating this post until I finish the 3D render version of this model.

## Modeling in ZBrush

### Body

I'll will use the old body basemesh with some adjustment.

### Face

In this project, I'll experiment posing with open mouth for this character.

### Heels

#### 12-07-2025

She wear high heels with `x` strings in middle and one circle string above her ankle. Only the heel is pink with a line of white while other parts is black. Base on footage in game, I don't see any strap buckle or anything or even zipper so I'll leave it as it is.

This is the current stage of the heel. I'll will adding heel's strings latter.

#### 13-07-2025

I'll leave it like this and start making clothes.
